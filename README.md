# AI-With-Personality

This AI uses the Llama algorithm to give a personality to the GGML models.
There is a config file that we can setup to describe the personality of the AI as well as changing some of the variables for the AI.

# How to Setup
Step 1: Clone the Repo into a folder

Step 2: Download The Model from Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15vE8kIPO6qF1M0kLiallWwUZSG4BMaRS?usp=drive_link

Step 3: Install the `requirements.txt` with `pip install requirements.txt`

Step 4: Open the config file and change `PERSONA_NAME` to the name of the personality

Step 5: Change `PERSONA_DESC` to the description of the personality in second person

Step 6: Run `python app.py`
